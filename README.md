The Playzer X-Series (or “PlayzerX”) provides developers, makers, engineers,
and students easy access to Playzer technology and its underlying VGLP
architecture on the platform of their choice. It provides both the option to
control the laser beam by external controllers via Analog Inputs, and the option
to control the laser beam by software via USB.

## Quick start




## Overview 

PlayzerX provides ease-of-access to the Playzer product line and VGLP architecture. The purpose of its simple analog or USB interface is to provide programmable beam steering.

With very low power consumption, devoted mostly to the supply of the laser driver, and with a highly compact mechanical profile, Playzer X-Series is well-suited for the development of many laser pointing applications. Users command x-axis and y-axis angle of the Scan Module laser beam as well as output laser power of the beam. 

Playzer X-Series provides simplified control of MEMS Mirror and Laser Beam with multiple interface modes:
- Analog Input
- USB (user switches to this Interface Mode with USB commands)

For full specifications including the optical scanning angle (field of regard), laser power, and point-to-point scanning bandwidth,
please see the [Mirrorcle Playzer X-Series - User Guide](https://mirrorcletech.com/pdf/PX/Mirrorcle_Playzer_X-Series_-_User_Guide.pdf).
